        <li>6 to 8 tablespoons curry powder</li>
        <li>1 tablespoons allspice</li>
        <li>3 pounds goat stew meat (use lamb or beef if you can't find goat</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>2 medium onions, chopped</li>
        <li>1 to 2 habanero or Scotch bonnet peppers, seeded and chopped</li>
        <li>1 (2-inch) piece ginger, peeeled and minced</li>
        <li>1 head garlic, peeled and chopped</li>
        <li>1 (15-ounce) can tomato sauce or crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon dried thyme</li>
        <li>3 to 4 cups water</li>
        <li>5 Yukpn gold potatoes, peeled and cut into 1-inch chunks</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <p>
    <ol>
        <li>Make the curry powder. You will need at least 6 tablespoons of spices for this stew, and you can kick it up
            to 8-9 depending on how spicy you like it.</li>
        <li>Cut and salt the goat meat into large chunks, 2-3 inches across. Salt everything well and set aside to come
            to room temperature for about 30 minutes. </li>
        <li>Heat the curry powder in oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Mix in 2 tablespoons of the curry powder
            and heat until fragrant. </li>
        <li>Brown meat in curried oil. Do this in batches and don’t overcrowd the pot. It will take a while to do this,
            maybe 30 minutes or so. Set the browned meat aside in a bowl. </li>
        <li>Cook onions, habenero, ginger, garlic. Add the onions and habanero to the pot and sauté, stirring from time
            to time, until the onions just start to brown, about 5 minutes. Sprinkle some salt over them as they cook.
            Add the ginger and garlic, mix well and sauté for another 1-2 minutes</li>
        <li>Put the meat (and bones, if using) back into the pot, along with any juices left in the bowl. Mix well.</li>
        <li>Pour in the coconut milk and tomatoes and 5 tablespoons of the curry powder. Stir to combine. If you are
            using 2 cans of coconut milk, add 3 cups of water. If you’re only using 1 can, add 4 cups of water. Add the
            thyme.</li>
        <li>Bring to a simmer and let it cook until the meat is falling-apart tender, which will take at least 2 hours.
            Longer if you have a mature goat.</li>
        <li>Once the meat is close to being done – tender but not falling apart yet – Add the potatoes and mix in. The
            stew is done when the potatoes are. Taste for salt and add some if it needs it.</li>
        <li>You might need to skim off the layer of fat at the top of the curry before serving. Do this with a large,
            shallow spoon, skimming into a bowl. Also, be sure to remove any bones before you serve the curry.</li>
    </ol>
    <em>Serve with Jamaican rice and peas or white rice.</em>
