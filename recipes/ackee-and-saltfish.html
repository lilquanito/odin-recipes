    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Ackee and saltfish is Jamaica's national dish, and makes the perfect breakfast or brunch. The nutty taste of the
        lobes of ackee is complemented perfectly by the sharp salinity and firm texture of salt cod.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p>
    <ul>
        <li>8 ounces of salt cod</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons of neutral oil, such as canola or vegetable</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons of diced yelllow onion, from 1/4 onion</li>
        <li>2 heaping tablespoons of diced bell pepper, from 1/2 bell pepper</li>
        <li>1/2 Scotch bonnet chile, stemmed, seeded, and minced</li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves, minced</li>
        <li>1 small tomato (about 2 ounces), cored and diced</li>
        <li>1 scallion (10g), thinly sliced</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons fresh thyme leaves and tender stems, chopped</li>
        <li>One 18-20 ounce can ackee</li>
        <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>Sliced avocado, for serving</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <p>
    <ol>
        <li>Rinse salt cod under cold running water until any salt on its surface is washed away.</li>
        <li>Transfer to a medium bowl and cover with fresh water. Soak at room temperature for 1 hour, or cover and
            refrigerate overnight.</li>
        <li>Drain salt cod, discard soaking water, transfer fish to a small saucepan, and cover with fresh water. </li>
        <li>Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, and cook until fish flakes easily when prodded with a fork, about 40
            minutes.</li>
        <li>Taste, and if the cod is still too salty—it should have a similar salinity to bacon—drain and discard
            cooking water, return fish to saucepan, cover with a fresh change of water, and boil for an additional 20
            minutes.</li>
        <li>Once the salt cod is cooked and seasoned to your liking, drain, and flake fish into 1/2- to 1-inch pieces,
            discarding any bones and silvery membranes. Set aside.</li>
        <li>In a 12-inch skillet, heat oil over medium heat until shimmering. Add onion, bell pepper, Scotch bonnet, and
            garlic and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the flaked salt cod and cook, stirring occasionally, until fish is heated through, about 5 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Add tomato, scallion, and thyme, stir to combine, and cook until vegetables are tender and mixture is
            aromatic, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add ackee, stir gently to incorporate, taking care not to over-mix which can cause the ackee to become
            mushy, and cook until ackee is heated through, about 3 minutes. Season with salt and pepper to taste, and
            serve immediately with sliced avocado alongside.</li>
    </ol>

    <em>Best Served immediately</em>
